This folder contains sample runs and outputs for the program.  Each training set is run (second argument) with different options (third and fourth arguments). Changing the third argument from 0 to 1 retrains the model, shown in cnn-3-1 to cnn-3-4.  Changing the fourth argument from 0 to 1 reconverts the FITS data to CSV files.  A sample of this execution is shown in cnn-2. Sample outputs for each of the three test sets are shown in results1,2, and 3.


Our program is run on Python 3.6.8, Keras 2.2.4, and TensorFlow 1.12.0.
